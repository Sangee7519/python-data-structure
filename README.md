# python-data-structure


Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation.
Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. 
Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.
we will discuss the Data Structures in the Python Programming Language and how they are related to some specific Python Data Types. 
We will discuss all the in-built data structures like list tuples, dictionaries, etc. as well as some advanced data structures like trees, graphs, etc.
# Lists

Python Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data.
It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
The implementation of Python List is similar to Vectors in C++ or ArrayList in JAVA. 
The costly operation is inserting or deleting the element from the beginning of the List as all the elements are needed to be shifted.
Insertion and deletion at the end of the list can also become costly in the case where the preallocated memory becomes full.
#createing list in python
List = [1, 2,  3, "GFG", 2.3]
print(List)
List elements can be accessed by the assigned index. In python starting index of the list, sequence is 0 and the ending index is (if N elements are there) N-1.
